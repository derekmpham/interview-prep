COMMONLY ASKED JAVASCRIPT QUESTIONS

Explain event delegation.

Event delegation is when you add a common event to multiple elements--including ones we may add in the future--by adding a single event listener to an ancestor element of these elements. This makes it easier for us, since we don't have to add the same event listener to every single element we want to add a common event to.
